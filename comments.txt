@Alyssa I was reading the reviews before buying this phone and i was super worried. But i went against the odds because my mom needed a new phone. The phone looks brand new. The only thing that was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with the appearance was the edge was slightly chipped but i barely noticed it and it covered with a case. The only thing i really have to complain about is it has 85% battery life which is still better than her old batter like percentage. I definitely recommend this brand if you need a new phone cheap! It also came with a screen protector on it already!
@pedro This person has false advertisement it tells you it comes with this but don't send nothing complete. You write on my email contact him he don't contact you at all or he tells you Ok on the emails don't buy from him he's a liar, he does false advertisement.
@Quri ONLY 1 TEENY TINY SCRATCH barely even noticed it, im so happy üòÅ, also came with a charger %26 charger box!! 4 day shipping to florida, for me

@guadalupe The phone came in almost perfect condition aside from the fact that there's a huge crack in the middle of the screen.
@bin Is a broken thing
@Dylan Has been repainted looks terrible and speakers are blown not good quality
@Adrianna It has a lot of scratches and it's a little bit broken from the screen!!!
@Hung Empty package
@Juan Being honest this phone doesn't work properly maybe I just have a bad luck, because it has problems updating software so I didn't even get the chance to see haw it works with phone calls or some basic use.
@Tamara Walmart delivered on time. But phone came without a sims card tray so phone won't work until I can find out wear to buy one

@gabrielle A refurbished phone is a fixed up used phone. Meaning the battery should have been replaced before reselling! The battery in the phone I bought was not, there's a 50 something percent battery life on the device.
@Cassandra The phone itself is amazing and I got a good deal on it I think‚Ä¶would definitely do it again if I ever need to. Having said that, I'm quite displeased with FedEx because they failed to follow directions and left my items OUTSIDE the apartment building even though I gave them the entry code to bring it to the door.! Tis the season for porch thief's and I'm not happy about it. I only got lucky because I happened to be home and was outside on the deck when they showed up‚Ä¶thus I was able to get my phone but that's beside the point! 5 stars for the phone and 1 star for FedEx
@Klint The phone seems to work fine and seems to have good battery life. The phone itself is pretty banged up though. You can't tell once I put it in a phone case though. I thought about returning it but I needed a phone and I already waited 3 days for this one to arrive. Getting a used phone is a gamble. You may get one that looks new or one that's beat up-looking. I would not consider my phone good condition. Maybe ‚Äúfair‚Äù at best.
@Kyle Ordered a phone for over $300 claiming to be refurbished. What I got was a scratched up phone missing paint in multiple places and a junk battery that was dead from a full charge in less than 8 hours on standby. Sure, it came wrapped in a plastic sleeve like a new phone would be, but the state of the phone isn't refurbished, it's flat out second hand used and abused. I give the review 2 stars cause at least it turns on and it's unlocked... but I won't be ordering from them again if this is what I get for over $300.
@George if the item needs to be received by somebody in the house, then you should have indicated the approximate time you expected it to arrive. its disappointing to have spent the whole morning hours in the house yet you haven't delivered. it looks like I gonna spend the whole in the house.
@Imis Scratched. Dented. Locked. Old garbage
@DavidYi Thought I would try the refurbished I phone 12 with no high expectations. I'm surprised at how good of a condition this phone is in and for under $250. Only been a few weeks but for now it's a five stars!
@Jylene I can say the phone is indeed fair for its price, light minor scratches but really can't complain still in good condition. I just got it hopefully no issues down the road. üòÑ
@jose Horrible refurbished phone, theirs a pin hole crack on the screen, a whole lot of scratches everywhere on the phone. I've bought a lot of refurbished phones in the past and none has ever looked like this. I'll be returning it right back to them today same day it came in. This phone is not good condition
@Yoana The cell phone is not in good condition, the description said excellent condition, the cell phone has a scratched screen, a scratched camera which affects the image quality and the sides are pitted as if it had been dropped several times, I need a refund since it is not It is as expected

@Jhonnel I love everything the phone have some details but for a refurbished phone was perfect conditions 100% recommend. I was scared because I read the comments after made the purchase but thanks god everything was good
@sheila The facial recognition stopped working less than a month after I bought it. Said it was probably a problem beforehand. Said to do updates and might fix but it did not. It's a refurnished phone but it's supposed to work if they are going to resell.
@Jp I don't understand the phone is refurbished: to renovate, to restore. Didn't think the phone would look as if it fell down a couple stories. The side of this phone are horribly dented.
@carol I am very disguisted with this company ! I bought a apple iphone and it won;t hold a charge and I just can;t get hold of anyone
@Hannah The phone had scratches and the speaker was blowed it was awful so I returned the phone and don't get my money back until a month
@John Nobody can hear me on the phone mic. i have to talk on speaker everywhere im at. Embarrassing!!! but I've been waiting on an iphone 11 and he got me the 12 so I'll keep it.
@Kimba The iphone12 I got is working very good only a few scracts on the sides but I bought a nice case and u can't see them. No scracts on the screen . I only had it a week so I hope it works this good for a long time.
@Isaiah Made the purchase before I read the previous views and I just knew people were lieing. My phone came with no problems at all just a tiny corner scratch that's not noticeable really but the phone works perfect. Good investment when I was gonna drop $600 plus on the same item.
@Derrick Purchased for my wife it was basically brand new I couldn't tell it was refurbished.
@Karen Screen scratched more than I'd like
@kailysta I'm missing my order and need it
@Richard i loved that it came so clean and everything also excellent condition
@R Wrong color, one speaker not working no one answering calls.
@Noemi Came perfect in the box with charger wire. Had a little bit of the edge messed up but wasn't that bad. I was satisfy
@angel The phone screen was scratched and in bad shape, also I ordered it in black they sent me a blue color
@Donna Back is a little beat up but flaws are expected, screen is great, so are the speakers, battery life is 90 which is amazing!
@Nelson Not what I ordered. The phone was smaller than the measurements in the description. Scratches on screen.
@Jalissa Mine came in good condition only a few minor scratches no scratches on the screen nor cracks i would deffinatley buy this again
@Nikki the phone turns on the battery is good but it has a lot of scratches and some dents the side overall don't recommend to buy
@Alyssa I had this phone less than 2 months, battery swelled making the phone unusable. Emailed the seller and they said they will not replace or refund.

@Xochilt Horrible just received and it's so bad totally marked up you have to put it on speaker to hear anybody
@rich I'm in process of returning the phone it turns off out of nowhere and is fully charged but still turns off.
@Chune Faulse advertized the Iphone as refurbished and it is not the battery was at replacement leverl of chargeing life. STAY CLEAR
@Alejandro I bought 4 phones and the chargers that came with the phones either dont not charge or slow to charge the phones.
@Deondre So far far good only have had it 3 weeks
@Serena Screen have a hair crack in it and phone looks like a child owned it and never had a case on it.
@Mark Everything came as told but everyone I call says I sound staticky
@Adrien You can see a little wear, but nothing bad, the battery is bad, it only has 88% life left and will NOT stay charged, I really should have spent the extra money and got a NEW phone.
@chris This is a very good phone, although it did arrive with some scratches on the screen. Other than that it's in very good used condition. I like the pale green color.

@Tao I like it but it's Christmas gift, so have no idea how it will work. I'm like a champ.
@Brian headphone failure, therefore it is a lie that it is in good condition
@Keandre Item condition is way worse than the description. The refund took a month.
@jaquetta This was a great purchase

@nickeisha I really didn't know anything about the phone my grand ask for it so I got them for them

@Queenbee After 3 months the phones have quit charging and will not charge and become useless they also never held battery life long when first bought
@Brian Watch out reff spec. In fact when Phone arrived, lots of scratches under protective foil, so I returned back and now waiting for money üí∞ return
@Felicia Please try your phone out before the 30 days. I purchased this phone for my son for Christmas. He hasn't even used it for 30 days and it keeps freezing. You have to wait for the phone to die before it works again. It's froze 3 times so far. I appreciate the 30 day warranty, but I believe exceptions should be made for Christmas. It should be extended. I just wanted to exchange the phone, but the company says no. I guess I will have to live and learn.
@Xavier So far great condition phone for a great price. Order a used iPhone 12. Advertised as good condition but it was near excellent imo. Only 1 small dent and a tiny scuff on edges that are covered by case. All parts were still original OEM (according to the IOS that now flags certain replacement parts)
@Bryson Very disappointed very scratched up
@Rylan Came nicely packaged with no issues or scratches on the phone
@amad Had a little chipping around the cameras but it was excellent even tho I traded 3 months later
@Courtney Takes awesome pictures and no problems
@Jacob Item did not come in original packaging which was okay but when I opened it the screen was super scratched up, the sides were dented and the back of the phone was scratched up. Very disappointed.
@Pushpa Phone had very minimal scratches, everything is functional and perfectly fine. But it had an 87% battery life. Still great for the price
@copiertech Do not buy this phone. You have to talk to everyone on speakerphone. It said it only had a few scratches. It scratched all the way up everywhere.
@bailee Phone came with dents and scuff on the sides and corners don't recommend buh everyone will get a different phone so who knows
@Anastashia The phone arrived with scratches on the screen
@Edson Good condition is not that great ‚Ä¶condition should be OK condition
@Amy very good phone no scratches
@Chris It came pristine and brand new and I have no problems with it.
@leyonr The IPhone arrived functioning perfectly. It was a really good purchase.
